# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

All stock entry analyzes compiled depending on the year he entered were given to the customer at any time. These years are 2017 and 2018. This worksheet is included with the VBA script macros. The signs may change depending on the desired years. In addition, the total volume corresponding to the desired year and the corresponding values for that year are included in the worksheet. Each page contains 12 stocks.

### Purpose

A well-organized data set, ensuring the accuracy of the results, fast execution of macros and time savings are the criteria that every customer may want. An analysis should both provide clear interpretations and be easy to understand.

The main purpose of this study is to make macros more efficient and to save time when more rows of data sets or more stocks are added. A practical printout is provided with a single click and year entry. If such a VBA macro is not created, it will take a lot of time and decrease the accuracy in data analysis. The aim here is to be able to achieve great work in a short time.

### Results

A separately edited file was created from the original script and then tested for correct operation. For this study, the outputs of 2017 and 2018 are shown and comparisons are made.
